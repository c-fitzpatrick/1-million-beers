# 1 Million Beers
A group of 1,024 lads are attempting to collectively drink 1 million beers.

All beers are logged in a WhatsApp group chat. Any beer, cider, stout or otherwise count. Regardless of size - a pint, a can, a bottle, or a 2 litre stein - all count as one beer.

Each photo should is accompanied by a message indicating the cumulative beer count.
